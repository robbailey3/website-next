# Rob Bailey's Portfolio

This repository is for my main portfolio site. If you've seen my GitHub over the past few years, you will have seen different repositories for my site, usually alternating between Angular and React - there was once one which had a PHP backend (ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). This one is written in React (Next.js to be precise).
Usually, I try and write my own API using NestJS and, whilst I think NestJS is great, it's always been more difficult and more expensive to host. That's why, this time, I've gone for NextJS as it's a great technology and has easy hosting with Vercel.

## Why?

A lot of developers have a portfolio. I thought I might as well.

## What's this built with?

- NextJS
- A bit of RxJS (because I like it)
- Jest and Cypress for testing (but I need to write more tests)
- Some different APIs (GitHub, Strava)

## What's on the roadmap?

I'll work on whatever I find interesting. If I make a fun canvas game, I'll probably add it here. I'm going to try and make something cool with tensorflow.

So, in summary, whatever is fun to code. Any suggestions? Let me know.

## Can I steal this?

If you want to create a portfolio like this (I doubt it, it's not that great), you'll probably benefit more from doing it yourself.

## Can I contact you?

Sure, you can email me [here](mailto:%20rob.bailey3+github-contact@gmail.com).
